Microservices Concepts ðŸš€

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This repository contains my learnings about Microservices Architecture, including different communication patterns and deployment strategies.

ðŸ“– Topics Covered

ðŸ”¹ Microservices Communication

Synchronous Communication

REST API (Representational State Transfer)

gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)

Asynchronous Communication

Message Bus

RabbitMQ for event-driven architecture

ðŸ”¹ Containerization

Docker was used to containerize the microservices for consistent deployment.

Created Dockerfiles for Platform Service and Commands Service.

ðŸ”¹ Orchestration

Kubernetes (K8s) was used for service orchestration.

Implemented Kubernetes Deployments, Services, and Pods.

ðŸ”¹ API Gateway

Used NGINX Ingress Controller for API Gateway.

Managed routing between Platform Service and Commands Service.

âš¡ Technologies Used

C# .NET Core for microservices

Docker for containerization

Kubernetes for orchestration

NGINX Ingress for API Gateway

RabbitMQ for event-driven communication

gRPC & REST for inter-service communication
